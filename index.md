The rapid evolution of global financial systems has provided new opportunities for sophisticated criminal networks. To counter these threats, it is no longer enough to develop isolated tools; we must build a unified front. This workshop is dedicated to establishing a collaborative research and development ecosystem specifically focused on AI technology to combat financial crime.
By bringing together industry practitioners, governmental agencies, and academic researchers, we aim to ensure that the next generation of AI innovation is directly informed by operational reality and legal necessity.

# Goals and Vision

**Integrated R&D:** Shift from fragmented pilot projects to a sustainable ecosystem where research priorities are aligned with the frontline needs of banks and investigators.


**Operationalizing AI:** Identify and overcome the technical, regulatory and organisational barriers to deploying AI in high-stakes environments, such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and fraud detection.


**Knowledge Exchange:**  Promote the exchange of research ideas and results between academic researchers,  and the practitioners who apply them in the field.

# Workshop Highlights

**Cross-Sector Collaboration:** Facilitate high-level networking between stakeholders who rarely occupy the same space, fostering long-term partnerships between the private sector, government, and academia.

**Interactive Sandpit Sessions:** Engage in intensive, collaborative "sandpit" environments where practitioners and researchers brainstorm and prototype AI-driven solutions for real-world bottlenecks, including data privacy and model explainability.

The goal of this workshop is to ensure that the cutting edge of AI research is translated into powerful, actionable technology that protects the integrity of the global financial system.

##Poster Session
For PhD candidates and researchers, we invite you to present your research during our Poster Session, where you can receive direct feedback from the practitioners and law enforcement leads who deal with these challenges daily. This is your chance to showcase your innovations to potential collaborators, find practical applications for your models, and play a defining role in building a safer financial future.
